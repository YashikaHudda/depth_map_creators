# depth_map_creators
Depth map creators are tools or models designed to estimate the depth information from a 2D image, allowing the conversion of flat images into 3D models. These tools are crucial in various applications, including 3D modeling, augmented reality, robotics, and more, where understanding the distance of objects within a scene is essential.
